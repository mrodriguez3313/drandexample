# What, Why, How?
Created a small script to show & describe how to get random numbers from the drand network.

Show how to seed true randomness into bias algorithms of selection. EG: Create true NFT rarity governed by the algorithm and not a creator. Common NFTs in a collection will have higher probability of being minted, while ultra-rare will have lower probability of being minted.

This script shortens down a `randomness` value from the network and uses it as a probability for selecting an item.

# Run
1. `npm install`

2. `node bias.js`
